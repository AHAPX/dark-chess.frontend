        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>The goal of this chess variant is not to checkmate the king, but to capture it. A player is not told if their king is in check. Failing to move out of check, or moving into check, are both legal, and can obviously result in a capture and loss of the game.</p>
        <p>Each player views a different version of the board, on which they can only see their own pieces, and the squares where these pieces can legally move. It is indicated to the player which squares are hidden, so a hidden square can never be confused with a visible empty square. As an example, it is always clear when an enemy piece is directly in front of a pawn, because that square will be hidden (as that is not a legal move for the pawn to make).</p>
